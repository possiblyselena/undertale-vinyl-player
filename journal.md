So this design session was spent researching parts and seeing how it would all line up together. I made my schematic in kicad because it would easiest to see it. However, I was on planning on making a pcb for this project, but unfortunatly I think this project is too big because a lot of the components are quite tall and would poke out from the case. So, I'm going to wire them all with a breadboard and hot glue them to the bottom of my case. I might still arrange them in the PCB editor to see how big I need to make the case and what shapes I need to make.
