So this design session was spent researching parts and seeing how it would all line up together. I made my schematic in kicad because it would easiest to see it. However, I was on planning on making a pcb for this project, but unfortunatly I think this project is too big because a lot of the components are quite tall and would poke out from the case. So, I'm going to wire them all with a breadboard and hot glue them to the bottom of my case. I might still arrange them in the PCB editor to see how big I need to make the case and what shapes I need to make.

# July 30th: CAD and Assembly
I used onshape to design the case with all the other things I needed. I really need to invest in calipers because I have to guess and check with my dimensions. I have a ruler I use in person to get a rough idea of what it'll look like, and then in assembly I import my components to double check what dimensions I need to adjust.

# July 31st: Firmware

guys this was hard. I used daniels program as reference, and since I had to add the stepper motor and oled I need to do more research on how to do it in python. I've worked with both in arduino, but I'm trying to be well-rounded i guess. So I looked for libraries and tutorials to figure out how to put them together. I have stop and start buttons as well, but I decided to leave them outside of the code until I get everything else working.
